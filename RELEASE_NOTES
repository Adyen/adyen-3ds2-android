## Fixed
* **Unit testing with SDK API classes**: The SDKâ€™s public API now resolves the issues that previously caused failures during Unit testing.

## Security
* **Device lock status check**: Introduced a new security measure that detects if the device is not locked by the user. When detected, the SDK generates an SW99 warning only for the app and not to the ACS.
* **Enhanced RASP and obfuscation**: Strengthened security through improvements in Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) and obfuscation to provide better protection against reverse engineering and other security threats.
